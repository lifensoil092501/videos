A cinematic product explainer video showing a scientific process in a storytelling sequence. 
Scene 1: Top-view of a transparent glass bowl filled with uncooked white rice grains. 
The rice grains are caricature-styled yet realistic, with visible dark metallic particles (representing heavy metals) clinging to them. 
Scene 2: Clean water is poured into the bowl, gently swirling around, but the metallic particles remain stuck to the rice — showing that normal rinsing doesn’t remove them. 
Scene 3: A transparent, unbranded squeeze bottle appears from the side. 
Two precise, slow-motion drops of a clear liquid fall from its nozzle into the bowl. 
The drops create subtle ripples and a sense of anticipation. 
Scene 4: The liquid diffuses elegantly through the water, creating a soft shimmering effect. 
The metallic particles begin to dissolve or fade away. Scene 5: The rice grains now appear pristine and white, symbolizing complete purification. 
The bowl sparkles gently under lab lighting. 
Visual style: semi-realistic 3D, clean and scientific with soft shadows and diffused lighting. 
Top-view composition throughout. 
Focus on storytelling and clarity. 
Color palette: whites, silvers, and soft blues to represent purity and science. 
Camera movement: subtle and cinematic (slow pans, slight zooms). 
Mood: elegant, intelligent, revolutionary. 
Duration: 10–15 seconds, optimized for website background. 
No branding, no text, just pure visual storytelling of transformation — showing how two drops can cleanse rice from heavy metals before cooking.

Create a cinematic product video in a dark, minimal studio environment with a spotlight illuminating a transparent squeeze bottle containing a clear, slightly viscous liquid. 
The camera is focused front and slightly top-down, keeping the bottle centered in frame. 
As the video begins, the bottle slowly compresses, and exactly two perfect drops of the clear liquid fall in slow motion into a transparent surface or invisible bowl(which contains long rice grains which are being soaked in water inorder to make it pure) below. 
Each drop should create gentle ripples and micro-particle diffusion in the liquid beneath — symbolizing the cleansing and heavy-metal removal action, leading to clean rice grains in bowl. 
Emphasize surface tension, reflection, and clarity of the drops — they should look pure, almost scientific. 
The lighting should feature soft rim highlights, cool blue-white hues, and a black or deep charcoal gradient background with faint mist or lab-like particles in the air. 
The bottle should look sleek, modern, semi-transparent, like a laboratory-grade squeeze bottle (not a spray or pump). 
The overall motion should be slow, elegant, and loopable (8–10 seconds). No hands, no branding, no text — just the bottle, light, and two drops performing a precise, minimal action. 
Slowly rotate or pan around the bottle to highlight light reflections, condensation droplets, and glass clarity — emphasising it as a scientific yet premium product. 
Style: Luxury scientific product reveal, macro cinematography, ultra clean aesthetic

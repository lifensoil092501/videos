A rice grain is growing in farm 
-> Come to a home in a packet 
-> A thin and tall rice grain, represented in form of a cartoon, has black and greyish blisters and pigmentation all over its body. 
It goes to the bathroom where it wants to take shower and bath 
-> he opens the shower through the tap attached to the wall of the bathroom 
-> water from the shower above falls down to the Mr. Rice 
-> it didnt clean the blisters and pimples, although it did clean the dirt on his body 
-> Mr Rice becomes sad -> a transparent squeeze bottle appears 
-> mr. rice picks up the bottle 
-> opens the cap of the bottle 
-> squeezes two transparent drops from a single nozzle of that bottle to his body 
-> the water is also dripping through his body 
-> gradually all his pigmentation, blisters and pimples disaappear 
-> he becomes happy -> starts dancing

A clean, futuristic product ad visualizing the science of purification. 
The video begins with an abstract digital visualization of heavy metal atoms attached to rice grains under water — metallic textures, microscopic view. 
Suddenly, a transparent squeeze bottle releases two crystal drops. 
They fall into the bowl in slow motion. 
The camera follows them as they ripple outward like waves of light. 
Microscopic particles detach from the rice, floating away and vanishing. 
The water becomes crystal clear, and the rice becomes luminous and pure. 
Add soft particle effects, smooth lighting, and a science-meets-art aesthetic like Apple or Dyson commercials. 
Use top and macro shots to make it immersive.
Tagline: “Two drops of brilliance. Purity engineered by nature.”

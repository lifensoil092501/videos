Create a high-quality cinematic cartoon storyboard (8–10 panels) showing the emotional and visual journey of a cute sack of rice discovering purity through a magical cleansing process. 
The story must be wordless, symbol-free, and text-free — all storytelling should happen visually through motion, color, and expression. 
Storyboard Arc (8–10 Panels) 
1️⃣ Panel 1 – Calm Morning in the Kitchen: Soft, warm tones. 
A cute sack of rice sits happily on a wooden counter, surrounded by other food ingredients. 
Sunlight glows softly through a window. 
Peaceful mood. 
2️⃣ Panel 2 – Unseen Threat: The mood subtly darkens. 
The rice grains are magnified microscopically to reveal tiny ghostlike caricatures of invisible heavy metals — gray, smoky figures floating between the grains. 
They’re not evil-looking, just mischievously hidden. 
3️⃣ Panel 3 – Unease: The rice sack looks slightly worried, watching a pot of rice being rinsed in dull, muddy water. 
Colors desaturate. 
The air feels heavy — symbolizing contamination. 
4️⃣ Panel 4 – Hope Appears: Shift in tone — a transparent bottle enters the frame, its surface glowing faintly aqua and gold. 
The light around it feels clean, soft, and radiant. 
5️⃣ Panel 5 – The Two Drops: The bottle gently squeezes out two glowing drops of liquid. 
The drops are luminous, suspended in mid-air — a blend of jade, gold, and soft aqua light. 
They fall toward the rinsing bowl below in slow motion. 
6️⃣ Panel 6 – Transformation Begins: The drops touch the water — the entire bowl begins to shimmer. 
The dull water clears, the mischievous gray figures dissolve into sparkles. 
The color palette transitions from muted to vibrant. 
7️⃣ Panel 7 – Microscopic Miracle: Close-up microscopic view. 
Heavy metal caricatures disintegrate into harmless dust that disperses as soft golden mist. 
Rice grains glow with clarity. 
8️⃣ Panel 8 – Purity Restored: The rice sack smiles — its surface now bright, its expression calm. 
The water around the rice shines with aqua-jade light. 
Everything looks fresh, balanced, and peaceful again. 
9️⃣ Panel 9 – Gratitude and Light: Wide cinematic view. 
The kitchen glows again with morning sunlight — now cleaner, brighter, and more serene. 
The air sparkles subtly with tiny motes of gold. 
🔟 Panel 10 – The Essence of Purity: Final shot: the rice sack standing tall, surrounded by a faint halo of purity and freshness. 
The tones are clean white, soft gold, and luminous jade — evoking health, calm, and renewal. 
Visual Style Guidelines: Cinematic cartoon aesthetic with painterly lighting and soft gradients. 
Use a color journey: dull beige → soft aqua → glowing jade and gold. 
Express emotion through light and composition — no text, symbols, or faces except subtle rice sack expressions. 
Keep the bottle and rice sack consistent across panels for continuity. 
Aspect ratio 16:9, soft film lighting, clean framing.

A warm morning light spills into a quiet kitchen. 
A chef — calm, precise, and mindful — stands by a counter with a large metal bowl filled with water and rice. 
The sound of running water fills the room — rhythmic, meditative. 
The chef’s hands swirl through the bowl, washing the grains. 
Camera slowly zooms in — past the rippling surface, past the translucent waves — into a microscopic, living world. 
We enter the world of rice grains(rice grains are long and thin, not like eggs) — a soft, glowing landscape of white and golden hues. 
Each grain stands upright like a tiny being- tall and thin, with pimples and blisters on its surface, shimmering under the water’s light. 
At the center stands Mr. Rice—different from the rest. 
His surface is dotted with soft pigments—pale brown and black marks. 
The chef pours the water into the bowl, and the grains giggle. 
Mr. Rice looks hopeful—closing his eyes as droplets run over his body, like he is taking a shower. 
He waits but when he opens his eyes… the pigments remain. 
Then, his smile fades. 
He rubs himself against nearby grains, splashes water, and even twirls—but nothing changes. 
The other grains areas are also doing the same and still carrying their stains. 
Frustrated, Mr. Rice mutters : “Why won’t the water cleanse me?” Back in the real world, the chef notices something. 
The water looks slightly cloudy, but the rice isn’t turning as pure as expected. 
The chef pauses, deep in thought. 
Then, the chef reaches for a transparent squeeze bottle resting on the counter. 
The bottle catches sunlight, gleaming like glass. 
Inside it — a clear liquid that seems almost alive. 
The chef gently squeezes the bottle and from the single nozzle of that bottle, 
two luminous and transparent drops fall descending through the air in slow motion towards the grains in the bowl. 
As they hit the water, the surface ripples outward in perfect circles—and light floods the bowl, and the rice grains(thin and long), their blisters and pigmentation starts to fade away. 
Mr. Rice looks up, awestruck. 
His reflection dances on the surface above him, glowing softly. 
The drops touch the water — and everything brightens. 
Mr. Rice feels something — a sense of calm, renewal, hope. 
Nearby, he notices a tiny transparent squeeze bottle floating toward him — an exact miniature of the chef’s. 
Its nozzle sparkles invitingly. 
He hesitates, whispering, “Could this be the answer?” He gently squeezes. 
Two delicate drops fall onto his body. 
A soft shimmer spreads across his surface — the pigments begin to dissolve like watercolor fading in the rain. 
The brown tints vanish, replaced by a flawless, pearly sheen. 
The blemishes disappear — but not harshly. 
It feels natural, as if revealing what he truly was underneath all along. 
For a moment, he stands in silence, watching his reflection ripple in the glowing water. 
His face lights up — not from vanity, but from relief, confidence, and peace. 
The other rice grains gather around, eyes wide with wonder. 
“You’re shining, Mr. Rice!” “How did you do that?” 
He smiles gently, “Sometimes… it’s not just water. 
It’s the right care — in just the right measure.” 
The light fades, and the camera zooms out — from the miniature world back to the bowl, the kitchen, and the chef. 
The chef looks down at the now pristine rice — glistening, pure, and uniform — and smiles knowingly. 
He drains the water, tilts the bowl, and the rice grains sparkle under the morning sun. 
As the chef prepares to cook, the faint reflection of Mr. Rice glows one last time on the water’s surface — smiling proudly, at peace.

A warm, softly lit kitchen. 
A chef stands at the counter, gently washing rice in a metallic bowl filled with water. 
Steam curls in the background. Camera zooms in — the world transforms. 
We enter the miniature realm of the rice grains. 
Each grain looks alive and expressive. 
Among them stands Mr. Rice, a slightly pigmented grain with soft pink and brown blemishes. 
He tilts his head up as clear water streams over him. 
Mr. Rice closes his eyes and lets the water flow, expecting to be cleansed — but when he opens them, the pigments remain. 
His tiny arms drop in dismay, eyes narrowing in frustration: “Why isn’t the water washing away my stains?” 
Cut to: the real-world kitchen again. 
The chef frowns thoughtfully, then picks up a transparent squeeze bottle from the counter — elegant and modern, with a single nozzle. 
Slowly, the chef squeezes it. Two crystal-like drops fall gracefully from the nozzle, catching the light as they descend into the bowl. 
Zoom in again — back to the world of Mr. Rice. 
The glowing drops drift down through the water like magical droplets of light. 
Mr. Rice gazes up, mesmerized, and reaches for a tiny transparent squeeze bottle of his own. 
He gently presses it — two shining drops land on his surface. 
The pigments start to dissolve, swirling away like colored mist. 
His body turns bright, smooth, and luminous — pure and radiant white. 
The other grains look on in awe as light ripples through the water. 
Mr. Rice smiles, gazing at his reflection — clean, confident, and reborn. 
The camera pulls back out to the chef, who smiles knowingly as the rice water clears. 
Mood: Warm, emotional, transformative. 
Visual style: Minimalist, cinematic, slightly magical realism with glowing reflections and soft lighting. 
Rice grains: Mr. rice - long and thin grains of rice, pimpled

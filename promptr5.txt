Cinematic product video of a sleek, minimal squeeze bottle pouring a clear liquid solution into a glass bowl filled with uncooked rice and water. 
The liquid disperses gracefully, creating soft swirling patterns as microscopic metallic particles fade away — symbolizing heavy metal removal. 
Elegant lighting with reflections on the bottle, subtle water ripples, and clean, high-end kitchen background. 
Modern, scientific yet aesthetic tone — pure whites, light blues, silver accents. 
Slow-motion macro details, droplets glistening, smooth transitions, 8K ultra-realistic visuals for a wellness-tech product launch background. 
The purpose of this video is to serve as background for website of product launch.

Cinematic slow-motion shot of a soft morning kitchen scene bathed in natural sunlight. 
On a clean marble counter, a minimalist matte-white squeeze bottle with subtle curved edges and a refined label is gently picked up by a hand. 
As the bottle is squeezed, a stream of crystal-clear liquid flows gracefully into a glass bowl containing uncooked rice and water. 
The liquid disperses in elegant swirls — impurities and metallic particles subtly fade away, leaving the water luminous and pure. 
Light flares glint off the droplets, evoking freshness and safety. 
The setting feels serene, premium, and believable — muted color palette of whites, light beige, and pale aqua blues. 
Depth-of-field bokeh, ultra-realistic reflections, smooth motion, designed for a looping 8K cinematic background on a modern wellness product website

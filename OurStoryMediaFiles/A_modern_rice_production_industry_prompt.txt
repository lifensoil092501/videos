A modern rice processing unit: machines hum as rice grains are cleaned, polished and packed into large sacks. 
Workers carefully seal and stack the sacks of rice stamped with labels. 
Then, a forklift lifts the sacks onto a delivery truck moving towards warehouse and homes. 
Use smooth, realistic transitions - like continuous camera motion following the grains' path. 
The tone should feel warm, natural and hopeful, showing progress and movement. 

Lightning: soft golden sunlight transitioning to cool industrial zones.

Composition: Cinematic depth, gentle motion blur, realistic details in the texture of long and thin rice grains, sacks, and dust motes in the light.

Mood: hopeful, purposeful, clean, transformative

style: realistic cinematic storytelling, documentary-grade detail, smooth continuity between shots.

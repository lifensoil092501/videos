A family kitchen at home - an indian household, where husband and wife are washing the rice by rinsing it with water to clean it. 
When they drain the water from bowl, the rice remains in the bowl - not even a single grain falls into the sink, and water gets drained as they're using strainer. 
They repeat the step to clean the rice even more as dirt is still there.

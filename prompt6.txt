Create a cinematic, story-style animation scene showing how a liquid removes heavy metals from rice. 
Frame 1: Close-up of realistic caricature-style rice grains with expressive sad faces, floating in a bowl of cloudy water. 
The grains are slightly yellowish-white, with visible metallic specks (silver, gray, and black dots) stuck on their surface, symbolizing heavy metals. 
Frame 2: The same rice grains are shown being rinsed with plain water — bubbles and ripples appear, but the heavy metal specks still cling to the grains. 
The grains remain dull and sad. 
Frame 3: A hand gently squeezes a transparent, unbranded plastic squeeze bottle with a pointed nozzle, releasing exactly two clear drops of liquid into the bowl. 
The water reacts slightly, showing soft ripples or sparkles. 
Frame 4: After rinsing again, the metallic specks disappear completely. 
The rice grains now appear whiter and brighter, with smiling, healthy expressions, floating in clear water. 
Style: clean digital illustration, semi-realistic with cartoonish expressions, warm lighting, minimalist background, storytelling composition, soft textures, and subtle reflections to convey purity and cleanliness.”

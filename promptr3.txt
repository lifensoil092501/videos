A cinematic, science-inspired storytelling video showing how a liquid solution removes microscopic heavy metals from rice.
The scene begins with a macro close-up of raw rice grains submerged in water. 
The environment feels clinical and pure, with a soft white background.
The camera transitions into a microscopic world, revealing subtle energy-like glows or molecular shimmer around the rice — abstractly representing heavy metals (not visible particles, but faint metallic halos or floating energy dots).
A transparent squeeze bottle appears above the bowl — sleek, unbranded, semi-glossy plastic. 
It gently releases two clear drops into the water. 
The drops fall in slow motion, creating elegant ripples.
Cut to the microscopic view again: as the drops disperse, the metallic halos start to dissolve into light — the heavy metals are being neutralized invisibly. 
The glowing traces fade smoothly, replaced by soft beams of clarity and purity.
The camera zooms out to show crystal-clear water and bright, clean rice grains, symbolizing purity and safety.
Lighting is clean, with a hint of blue-white radiance. 
The tone feels scientific yet poetic, inspired by Dyson or Apple product ads.
Tagline at the end:
“Just two drops. Pure brilliance, invisible protection.”

Scene 1 – The Unseen Threat Ultra-close cinematic shot of pristine rice grains soaking in a clear glass bowl filled with water. 
Everything looks pure — until subtle, shimmering microscopic metallic glows start pulsing faintly around each grain. 
These are heavy metals, invisible to the naked eye but represented through elegant, translucent energy waves — not particles, not dirt, just a gentle iridescent aura hinting at contamination. 
The tone is scientific, calm, and cinematic, evoking mystery and precision. 

Scene 2 – The Futile Wash A slow-motion rinse: clean water cascades beautifully over the rice. 
The metallic shimmer still lingers faintly, showing that ordinary rinsing isn’t enough. 
The lighting is cool white with subtle reflections, emphasizing the purity of the scene while hinting at what remains unseen. 

Scene 3 – The Two Drops The camera pans upward as a sleek, transparent squeeze bottle enters the frame. No branding, no labels — just elegance and purpose. 
The bottle squeezes exactly two drops of crystal-clear liquid into the bowl. The droplets fall in ultra slow motion, rippling through the water like pearls of light. 
Each drop lands with a ripple that sends waves of soft blue luminescence, representing molecular cleansing power spreading through the bowl. 

Scene 4 – The Invisible Purification Return to the microscopic world — the metallic glows dissolve gracefully into light particles, fading away into pure clarity. 
No harsh transitions — only smooth, poetic transformation. 
The rice grains now gleam naturally, free from their invisible burden. 
The soundscape swells softly — water, light, serenity. 

Scene 5 – The Reveal The camera zooms out. 
The rice sparkles subtly under daylight, the water perfectly clear. 
The transparent bottle stands quietly beside the bowl, symbolizing simplicity, science, and purity. 
Lighting shifts warm — symbolizing safety and nourishment.

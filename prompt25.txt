A rice grain begins its journey growing beautifully in a lush green farm under warm sunlight. 
The scene transitions as the grain is harvested, packed neatly into a packet, and finally arrives at a cozy home kitchen.
Inside the packet, one thin and tall cartoon rice grain — named Mr. Rice — steps out. 
He has black and greyish blisters, spots, and pigmentation all over his body, giving him an unhealthy look.
Curious and hopeful, Mr. Rice walks into a bathroom, designed like a human bathroom but scaled to his tiny size. 
He stands under a modern wall-mounted shower and turns on the tap.
Water flows gently from the shower, falling down on Mr. Rice’s body, washing off the surface dirt and dust. 
But the blisters and dark pigmentation remain unchanged. 
Mr. Rice looks down sadly, his expression showing disappointment as the water drips off his dull surface.
Suddenly, a transparent squeeze bottle appears beside him — elegant and glowing faintly, symbolizing innovation.
Mr. Rice picks up the bottle, twists open the cap, and squeezes two transparent drops from a single nozzle onto his body. 
The drops land gracefully and merge with the water already running down his surface.
As the liquid spreads, a magical yet scientific transformation begins — the dark blisters, grey patches, and pigmentations gradually fade away. 
His surface becomes clean, smooth, and bright white, glistening under soft light.
Overjoyed, Mr. Rice smiles widely, spins around, and starts dancing gleefully under the shower — water droplets sparkling around him, symbolizing purity, rejuvenation, and cleanliness.

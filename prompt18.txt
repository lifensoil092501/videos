In a quiet kitchen, the chef’s hands stir a bowl of rice — simple grains, yet each carries its own story. 
Among them lives Mr. Rice, marked with pigments of time and earth. He lets the water flow, hoping for renewal. 
But no matter how much he’s washed, his stains remain. 
He wonders — “Is purity so hard to find?” 
Then, from above, two drops descend — clear as morning dew, glowing with promise. 
They touch the water, and suddenly, the world shifts. 
Mr. Rice feels their embrace, cool and gentle. 
The pigments fade, the blemishes dissolve, and beneath them shines what was always there — his true self, radiant and whole. 
The chef smiles. The rice shimmers like pearls. 
Sometimes, it isn’t water that cleanses — it’s care, precision, and the right touch. 
Tone: Emotional, symbolic, and elegant. 
Theme: Transformation through purity and science — the art of gentle cleansing.

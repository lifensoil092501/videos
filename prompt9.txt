“Create a serene, nature-inspired product story. 
Start with a visual metaphor — dew drops on a rice plant under morning light, symbolizing purity. 
Cut to harvested rice being rinsed in a glass bowl, where hidden dark metallic particles glimmer faintly. 
A gentle hand squeezes a transparent bottle — exactly two drops of clear liquid fall into the water. 
The liquid blends like morning light dissolving into mist. 
The heavy metals vanish gracefully, leaving rice grains sparkling clean and natural. 
The tone should be soft, organic, hopeful — like a revolution in purity emerging from nature itself.” 
Tagline: “The whisper of clean. Two drops that change everything.”

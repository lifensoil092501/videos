Generate a cinematic top-view video of uncooked white rice grains being poured into a clear glass bowl filled with clean water. 
Focus exclusively on the bowl and rice — no table, background, or surrounding elements visible. 
As the rice enters, the water should gently ripple, creating graceful swirls and bubbles in slow motion. 
Show a visual transformation as the water becomes slightly cloudy and then gradually clears — symbolizing the cleansing of heavy metals and impurities. 
Maintain a minimal, elegant aesthetic with soft natural lighting and pure white and transparent tones. 
The video should evoke purity, science, and cleanliness, suitable for the hero background of a modern biotech product website. 
Ensure ultra HD (4K) quality, loopable motion, and a smooth, calm rhythm. 
Composition: Top-down shot, centered bowl, no background, no text, no human presence.

A chef is gently washing rice grains in a bowl of water. 
Zoom in gradually to reveal the tiny world of the rice grains — they come alive as characters. 
Among them is Mr. Rice, a pigmented grain with colored blemishes on his surface. 
As water flows over him, Mr. Rice closes his eyes and smiles, expecting to become clean — but when the water passes, his pigments remain. 
His expression turns puzzled and frustrated: “Why isn’t the water removing my stains?” 
Now zoom out again to the real-world kitchen scene. 
The chef pauses, realizes something, and picks up a transparent squeeze bottle with a single nozzle. 
The chef gently squeezes it — and two luminous drops fall from the bottle into the bowl where the rice is being rinsed. 
Zoom in again, returning to the miniature world. 
The glowing drops drift down like magical liquid light. 
Mr. Rice picks up a tiny version of the same transparent squeeze bottle, squeezes two drops onto himself — and as the liquid spreads, his pigments and blemishes dissolve, revealing a smooth, radiant white grain. 
He looks at his reflection in the water — smiling, fresh, and pure — while the other rice grains watch in awe as the water shimmers around them.
